There are enemies and circumstances which are so dire that even a hero will fall to them. When a characterâ€™s current Health would fall to zero, they are immediately knocked unconscious. Their life stats otherwise regenerate as normal, however any active effects or spells are discontinued. However, should the damage dealt to a character bring their HP to a negative number equal to at least half of their maximum HP, before spells and effects are factored in, they fail to recover immediately from their wounds and die. Their life stats cease to recover, and their magicka and stamina falls to zero.
