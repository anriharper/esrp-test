The field of battle is often dotted with strategic obstacles that can be put to good use. If such an obstacle is large enough and stands between an attacker and their target, the target becomes more difficult to hit. There are two kinds of cover:

#### Half-Cover
As the name suggests, this is any obstacle such as a wall or even a pile of crates which conceal at least half the individual. Attacks aimed at a target under half-cover must succeed on at least a raise to hit.

#### Full-Cover
If the obstacle provides coverage for the vast majority or even all of the individual, they are under full-cover. In this case, attacks aimed at this target must succeed with at least two raises to hit, assuming any possible opening may exist. When attacking from full-cover, the attacker must either hit with two raises by attacking blindly or move to at least half-cover to attack without penalty.


Both of these effects are in place whenever a target would evade into cover.
