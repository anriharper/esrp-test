Much like casting a spell, it is assumed that a character can successfully perform any ability they have learned, unless the roll is botched. The roll still must succeed against any relevant passive TN or opposed rolls to land a hit, if the ability is targeted.
  
The TN therefore serves as a number which determines values for raises.
