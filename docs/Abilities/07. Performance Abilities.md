If any enemy affected takes damage before the start of the user’s next turn, they may reroll this save, succeeding as long as it does not raise their CHA check. All enemies who are within 30ft of the user at the start of their next turn after using this ability and have not succeeded their save to break free are stunned |

| Finale  |  120  |     250      | The final chords, the epic conclusion! The bard spends their turn crafting their final song, with naught but the haunting call of the final applause ahead. All allies within 120ft are inspired, succeeding all rolls that failed by less than a raise and re-rolling up to one saving throw each for the next round. If the bard has less than one-quarter of their maximum remaining health when this ability is used, all affected allies also gain a +10 to all attribute and skill rolls. If the bard has been reduced to 0 HP or less within the last round, or within the next round, an encore plays and extends this ability for another round. As an additional cost, the bard’s SR is reduced to a maximum of 0 for 24 hours. This ability can only be used once per day. |
