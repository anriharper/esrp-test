|     Redirect      |   -   |     100      | Once a shield becomes an extension of the user, even the arcane falls short of breaking their defence. This ability may be used as a reaction to a spell which targets the user or an ally, so long as the trajectory of the spell passes within 5 ft of the user. So long as the block roll to perform this ability is not raised at least twice against the casting roll, the spell deflects off the user’s shield and strikes the ground at a declared location up to 20 ft to the left or right of the user. Otherwise, should the spell hit, the user reduces its damage by a full blocking roll. |
