| Diving Roll |   -   |      35      |                                                     When failing an evade check, use a bonus action to tumble an additional five feet away and halve the incoming damage after armor and resistances. Using this ability leaves the character off balance until the end of the round                                                     |
|   Exhaust   |   -   |      -       | If the user does not have enough stamina to Evade, they may use any remaining stamina and use this ability as a reaction to perform an Evade. Using this ability leaves the character off balance. If the user is already off balance or any effect would cause them to be off balance before their next turn, this leaves them Stunned. |
