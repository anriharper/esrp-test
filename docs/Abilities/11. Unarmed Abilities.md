| Grappling Strike |   -   |      20      | Attempt to lock a target of standard size within melee range in a grapple, making an unarmed attack which does not deal damage.

| Follow the Flow |   -   |      40      | Forgo the movement step and prepare an action against a coming blow. When an enemy makes a weapon attack against the user and is within 5ft, roll an opposing Martial Arts skill check. If the user succeeds against the opponent’s attack roll, the incoming attack fails and they are moved to a space within 5ft of the user. |
| Turn the Blade  |   -   |      20      |                 Use a Martial Arts skill roll to perform a blocking reaction against a non-ranged weapon attack at a +2, rolling unarmed damage for the blocking pool. On a raise, make a retaliating unarmed strike against the attacker. A martial weapon attack can be made instead for an additional 10 SP.                  |

| Drunken Form  |   -   |      50      |           The user enters a state of intoxication on their turn, putting themselves off balance. Their Passive TN increases by 4 and unarmed attacks are rolled at a +4. These effects last until the user deliberately ends them on their turn. While active, the user may make an unarmed attack after any successful reaction for no additional cost.            |
| Stem the Tide |   -   |  60SP/60MP   | The user strikes a foe with an unarmed attack and channels their will to disrupt the enemy.
