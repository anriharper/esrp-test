### The Ritual

The sign can manifest in one of two ways and the character chooses one in character creation: Ritual of Sithis or Mara’s Ritual.  
Ritual of Sithis allows the character to use this power once per day to raise up to five dead below the character’s level within 75 feet (maximum of 10) for 10 rounds, or deal 50 points of magicka damage to all enemies within 50 feet.  
Mara’s Ritual can be used once per day to either deal damage to all undead or heal all allies within 60ft for damage or healing equal to three times their HR. Damage dealt to undead counts as sun damage.
