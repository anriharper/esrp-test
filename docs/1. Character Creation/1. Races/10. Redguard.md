There are a number of conflicting tales regarding the Yokudans who left their home continent for Tamriel in the First Era. Most now believe that Yokuda was swallowed by the sea by an unknown event, causing the remaining fleets to sail east until they landed in what is now called Hammerfell. Reguard history holds that Frandar Hunding won the War of the Singers, the final war in Yokuda, after the Last Emperor Hira of the Ansei called on his aid. Legend has it that in the wake of the bloody conflict, Yokuda sank into the sea and the forces that sailed with Hunding across the Eltheric Ocean became known as the Redguards. The incredibly skilled warriors wrested control of Hammerfell from man and mer alike in a matter of months, and after the Siege of Orsinium nearly two centuries later began to trade with their neighbors. In the sprawling Alik’r desert, the mountains of Bangkorai and Craglorn, and rocky wastelands beyond the lush grasslands of Hammerfell’s coasts, the Redguards built walled cities composed of towering dome structures with novel ventilation systems. Though newer to Tamriel than the other races, Redguard warriors are considered the most skilled and disciplined in the world and their advanced naval forces have been matched only by the Empire’s greatest armadas. They have a dark complexion, ranging from soft brown hues to midnight tones that are almost black, often all with characteristic red and orange undertones. They have brown to amber eyes, and dark hair that usually curls elegantly in shades of brown and black. It is common for them to have tattoos and piercings, and Redguard fashion is known to be some of the most diverse and vibrant in all of Tamriel. They have a long standing distrust of magic and enchantments, and very few of their people become mages. Though several of the Divines are among their pantheon, the deities of Yokuda predominate their religion. The dead are honored by the rite of Tu’whacca. Satakal, Ruptga, and Leki are often also venerated. In the afterlife they strive to reach the Far Shores, a place between time and space where they may await the new worlds created by Satakal’s endless movement.
