The Aldmer who rejected the worship of the Aedra followed the prophet Veloth, and among other deities sought favor from Azura, Boathia, and Mephala after settling in the land of Resdayn. They would be called Chimer and their new home would later be known as Morrowind. The conflicts that arose between them and the neighboring dwemer resulted in terrible consequences. The Chimer who descended from Veloth’s followers were cursed by Azura after the disappearance of the dwarves for breaking an oath to the goddess and following the Tribunal who arose from the Battle of Red Mountain. They became ashen toned with red eyes, and as the Dunmer they went on to create great cities in the eastern fens and volcanic mountains. Their story from then on was one harsh and marred with ill-fortune and conflict. The volcanic heat gave them a natural resistance to fire, and their society of Great Houses gave birth to skilled and versatile warriors. But their civilization was built on the blood and sweat of slavery, with plantations and mines worked mostly by khajiit and argonian captives even into the waning years of the 3rd Era. Morrowind cultivated a unique culture, dominated for millennia by the god-like Tribunal. Theatre and universities arose alongside government sanctioned guilds of assassins, and a flourishing economy that remained strong through most of recorded history. The dunmer are proud and often haughty, but also passionate and daring.
