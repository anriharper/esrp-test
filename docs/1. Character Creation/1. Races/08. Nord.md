Lying beyond the northern Sea of Ghosts is the frozen island of Atmora, long believed to be abandoned by the Nedes who would settle a northern portion of Tamriel. Their descendants, the Nords, came from the warlord Ysgramor and his Five-Hundred Companions of old to claim Skyrim and become perhaps the first humans to settle in Tamriel. Large, imposing, and accustomed to the cold climate of their homeland, the Nords have known only battle since their arrival. They sundered the Snow Elves and Dwemer who originally inhabited the land and drove them to the east, fought the giants whose remnants still herd mammoths across the tundra and planes, and rebelled against the Dragon Cult and their immortal masters. They even tried and failed to conquer Morrowind in the First Era, thwarted by a combined Chimer and Dwemer force. War is in their blood and life is often short-lived and harsh in Skyrim. So much so that for thousands of years the position of High King carried a life expectancy of less than a year. The High King could be challenged to trial by combat, a Moot of the nine Holds’ Jarls could elect a new leader, and Nord nobility never cease to seek to prove themselves worthy of a higher place in their court. They have long worshipped the Aedra, as well as Shor who holds dominion of the great halls of Sovngarde, where all Nord warriors hope to dine in for eternity by dying honorably in battle. Travelling bard adventures bring music to the countless taverns dotting the lands, ever flowing with ale and mead. Their capital cities are ruled by courts headed by a Jarl, often accompanied by a steward, a court wizard, and an assembly of Thanes and their housecarls. The Jarl commands authority over their district, answering to the High King, who through most of history has been allied to the Cyrodiilic empires. Nords are taller than other humans, with fair skin and lighter red, brown, or blonde hair. Their eyes are typically green or blue, though sometimes brown or amber. Their physical abilities make them formidable soldiers, mercenaries, and sailors, as well as dependable farmers and miners. Since life is short, they often marry early and quickly, simply wearing an Amulet of Mara to signify that they are single and looking to start a family.
