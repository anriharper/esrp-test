This is a brief introduction to the [ten playable races](####Races) covered by this core manual. Each race contains a suggested set of starting Attributes and Skills, as well as their natural bonuses and a list of possible Natural Powers they may choose to take.

To make a character with more unique starting Attributes and Skills, here are the rules used to generate them:

For Attributes, allot 245 points across the seven Attributes. An Attribute cannot be lower than 15, nor can it start higher than 45. The easiest way to do this is to set every Attribute to 35, and rearrange the points by taking them from one Attribute to increase another.

For Skills, each starting character is given 35 extra points to their starting Skills based on their race. A Skill cannot start above 45, and Skills start at a base of 10.
