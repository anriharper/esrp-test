The proud and often reserved High Elves have long been a dominant force in shaping the social, political, and scholastic spheres of modern culture throughout Tamriel. They are exceptionally tall compared to mortal races, averaging just around 7ft in height with gold or brass toned skin and typically golden, green, or amber eyes. From their long-lost ancestral home of Aldmeris, the predecessors of the altmer settled in the Summerset Isles and spread throughout Tamriel. Altmer society developed a rigid hierarchy and formed closely around a pantheon of Aedra (“ancestors” in their tongue) such as Auriel, Trinimac, Syrabane, Phynaster Magnus, and Y’ffre. Though their religion has fluctuated between the eras, worship of the Divines has more often than not gone hand-in-hand with Altmer culture. Their long lifespan and incredible attenuation to the arcane arts have produced some of the most prolific magi in the history of Tamriel, and many scholarly orders find their roots in the Summerset Isles
