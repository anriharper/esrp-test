### Argonian

  
To the other people of Tamriel, the reptilian Argonians, also called Saxheel or People of the Root, are shrouded in mystery. Their homeland of Black Marsh, sometimes called Argonia, is a dangerous swamp lying in the southeast reaches of the continent. Many of them believed their souls were a gift from the Hist trees that dominate this region, and it is said that the sap of these sentient trees plays a large role in the physical development of each them. Their native tongue is Jel, a language of incredible nuance and complexity derived from the Hist themselves. Few, if any people of the other races have ever been able to learn it. Their tribes make their homes deep in the marshes, whose towering canopies can all but blot out the sun, and build their settlements from mud or clay and sometimes wood. The once magnificent xanmeers constructed by their ancient ancestors are reclaimed by the roots and vines, the pyramid structures serving as a reminder that in Argonia all things are better built to be temporary. Still, Argonian craftsmanship and jewelry is revered around the known world, and their alchemical knowledge and precision is almost unparalleled. While friendly, they tend to be socially guarded and slow to trust but fiercely loyal to their friends. (Coloration, height, eye-color…ahem…plumage?)
