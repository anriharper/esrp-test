The colossal trees of the Valenwood are sacred to the Bosmer, who are believed to have arisen in the time long before recorded history from a shapeshifting collective. Typically smaller than the other mortal races, the Wood Elves as they are sometimes called have dark bronze to chestnut or deep brown skin tones with black, amber, or brown eyes. They are nimble, quick-footed, and known to be great marksman. Many of the Bosmer follow the Green Pact, refusing to harm any plant life of the Valenwood and eating a diet of meat and insects. They make their homes in great trees such as the wandering graht oaks, giving rise to incredible trading cities such as Falinesti. The Bosmer are seen as free-spirited and joyous, and equally fierce when protecting their land and customs. Their Silvenar and Green Lady are the leaders of Valenwood, both politically and spiritually.

**Natural Powers** (Choose One):

- Call of the Green Pact

	Once per day the character can call upon the sacred Pact, convincing any animal whose level is lower than their own and is within 500ft to become their ally for one hour (refer to [[COTG|this table]] for required rolls). If no visible animal is nearby but the character is anywhere an animal may reasonably inhabit, they can activate this power and roll on the following table to summon a random ally for one hour. The animal called in this way arrives at the end of the next round after this power is used. If no such animal lives in the area, the GM may choose the closest local fauna in terms of level. 

- True Strike

	The character uses keen focus and clears their mind to land their next attack, automatically hitting and dealing more damage. This power can be used once per day to modify any attack or healing ability, dealing damage or healing equal to half the userâ€™s max SP.
