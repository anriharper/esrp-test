[Blessings](####Blessings) cost points, [curses](####Curses) gain points. A character can at most have three blessings and two curses.

The player begins with 10 points to acquire Blessings, each of which has a cost listed next to it. To take more and stronger Blessings, the player can take any Curse. The point value for Curses are negative, meaning taking them gives the character more points to spend on Blessings.

Ex. Character starts with 10 points, and to afford a Blessing which costs 20, they take a Curse valued at -10. ((Note: - sign could be confusing))
