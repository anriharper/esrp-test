Sometimes character creation just needs a little extra something to give the party a unique twist. Pasts are aspects that can be given to a character to help drive the story. Each character may roll on the table to have a certain random past, decided by rolling a d100.

| **d100** | **Past**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-4      | Bounty                 | A warrant for the character’s arrest stands in a county, hold, or city somewhere in Tamriel. If caught by the guards in that place they will certainly be arrested to serve their sentence or defend themselves in court.                                                           |
| 5-9      | Crossed Paths          | A friend or family member often runs into this character, and often brings chaotic events with them.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 10-14    | Haunted                | A mischievous or even malicious spectre follows the character wherever they go, and with little adjustments and small actions seeks to make their life more difficult.                                                                                                              |
| 15-19    | Nemesis                | Adventurers often make close friends along the way, but sometimes they will make lifelong enemies. The character has someone who is their nemesis, their foil, their antithesis, whether the relationship be competitive or deadly.                                                 |
| 20-24    | Refugee                | The character has known their share of suffering, as some cataclysmic event in their past led them to leave their home in search of safety and a new life. Perhaps it was war, perhaps a natural disaster.                                                                          |
| 25-29    | Folk Hero              | The character performed a great deed in a small town or village, and the people there remember them kindly. Maybe they also have advantages when talking to people in towns or villages? Does the place they’re a hero aid them in their hour of need                               |
| 30-34    | Ashes of the Ancestors | The character carries with them a small urn containing the ashes of a parent or other close relative. They find themselves on a grand and long quest to find the perfect location to spread the ashes and let them be at peace.                                                     |
| 35-39    | Premonition            | A strange dream has come to them in their sleep, perhaps it is recent or perhaps it has persisted for their entire life. The vision tells of an event yet to unfold but is vague and brief.                                                                                         |
| 40-44    | Ally                   | A close friend is always willing to aid the character, and sometimes crosses their path and lends a hand.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 45-49    | Sole Heir              | The character is the last member of a long and relatively well known lineage. The responsibility, and should they find it inheritance, of all their predecessors rests on their shoulders.                                                                                          |
| 50-54    | Amnesia                | The character woke up recently with almost no memory of their life beforehand. Maybe the memories will never come back to them, but the only direction left is forward.                                                                                                             |
| 55-59    | Treasure Map           | The character has found a treasure map and has made it their quest to decipher it! It could be a riddle, a clue, a simple drawn map, anything leading to a no doubt grand adventure.                                                                                                |
| 60-64    | Possession             | An otherworldly spirit or creature is tethered to the character, always in the back of their mind and waiting for control. When the character rolls any check where the majority of the dice land on the same number, the entity may take control of them for three rounds.         |
| 65-69    | A Night to Remember    | A likely alcohol-fueled romp took the character on an unpredictable adventure. Unfortunately they could not remember a moment of it when they next awoke in a daze. The exact events are up to the GM, but typically involve two helpful acts and two reckless                      |
| 70-74    | Unwanted Inheritance   | A relative has passed, leaving the character with some unfortunate inheritance. Now it burdens them.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 75-79    | Dishonor               | The character had brought shame upon their family, and has been shunned and exiled for it.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 80-84    | Buried Treasure        | The character hid a grand and valuable treasure…if only they could remember where.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 85-89    | Town Clown             | The character was once a prominent figure or nobility in a certain town, village, or even city. By accident or malicious intent, they have since been rather unkindly exiled.                                                                                                       |
| 90-94    | Abducted               | The character has an insane delusion that either the Ayleids or Dwemer still walk among the mortal realm, and have on at least one occasion been abducted by the sinister elves!                                                                                                    |
| 95-99    | The Muse               | The character is the subject of an art of substantial note. Whether a painting or a ballad, people across the continent may recognize the muse. The depiction may be positive or negative to those aware of it, depending on the connotation of the art and the person in question. |
| 100      | Accursed               | The character was bitten by an accursed creature recently, such as a vampire or werecreature, and turned into one themselves.                                                                                                                                                       |
