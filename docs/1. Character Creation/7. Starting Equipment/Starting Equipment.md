Every player character begins with 150 septims (denoted with ‘g’ from here on) to begin buying the equipment they will start the game with. The remainder of their current wealth is determined by their income, which is an amount of gold their work and lifestyle would allow them over the course of a month. Whatever remains after buying starting equipment is gold that the character may keep on hand for the start of the game. Each player has the option to take the average income of 250g, or roll on the following table to have an income assigned randomly.

| Roll (1d100) | Income |
| ------------ | ------ |
| 1-5          | 0      |
| 6-15         | 50     |
| 16-30        | 150    |
| 31-70        | 250    |
| 71-85        | 350    |
| 86-95        | 450    |
| 96-100       | 550    |

  

Keep in mind that income does not necessarily mean that during a campaign a character will be given this amount per month. At any given point the campaign may start, this is likely the buying power they have at that moment. A blacksmith may be making 350g per month in their line of work, but likely will not get the chance to earn that income when whisked off on a grand adventure.

Starting Equipment can be chosen from the items listed in [[Table of Contents#Items and Equipment|Items and Equipment]], however there are a few general rules to follow. As previously suggested, the pool of money available to purchase starting equipment is calculated by adding 150g to the monthly income. All starting items are procured at their base cost. A character cannot start with armor higher than Tier I or weapons stronger than steel. It is assumed that they can easily procure a small backpack or satchel without having to spend their starting gold on one, as well as a water skin if they choose. A starting character may also purchase an enchantment of level 25 or lower for any equipment they own, and can also buy new spells that they have a sufficient level to cast as outlined in Section IV.
