Skills are divided into Combat and Non-Combat types. A starting character is given 100 points to distribute amongst their base skills as they see, raising them by one level per point spent. A base skill cannot be higher than 45, and all skills start at a base of 10. At this point, the player chooses three core skills, as described further in Section VIII under Skill Perks.
