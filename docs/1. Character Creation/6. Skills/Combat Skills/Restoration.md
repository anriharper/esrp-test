### Breton

The nedic people of Atmora were said to be the first humans to arrive in Tamriel, beginning their settlements in the lands that in modern times became High Rock and Skyrim. The nedes of High Rock formed strong relationships with the elven Admer when they still dominated much of the continent, and from the many unions came the man-mer Bretons. Though the elven Direnni clans were driven from High Rock in early recorded history and the Ayleid civilization faded with time, the breton kingdoms flourished from a unique combination of intellectual pursuit and a passion for the arts. Grand castles gave rise to sprawling cities like Daggerfall and Wayrest, and agrarian societies whose adventurous youth sought to climb the social ladder by striking out on quests. Though often pale in complexion and slimmer than other humans, Bretons have a diverse range of hair and eye color. Their elven ancestry gives them an innate ability to learn magic, with some accounts telling of breton children casting illusion spells at one another in the streets of cities for fun.
