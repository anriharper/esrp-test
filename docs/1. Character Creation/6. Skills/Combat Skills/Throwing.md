### Throwing

Using thrown weapons requires practice and a good understanding of balance and trajectory. Throwing knives, axes, and javelins are all governed by the Throwing skill. It also determines a characterâ€™s ability to effectively throw any object light enough to be handled, such as bottles, rocks, or even a sweet roll.
