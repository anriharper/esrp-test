Combat styles which are generally built around martial prowess. The Martial Arts skills encompasses both purely unarmed forms as well as forms that incorporate certain weapons. Unarmed attacks deal 1d4 damage plus 1/10th of the attacker’s STR rounded down. If using a fist weapon, this damage is replaced by the weapon’s. At level 25 in Martial Arts, the character may choose a martial weapon which is specifically incorporated into their style. What constitutes a martial weapon is ultimately up to the discretion of the DM. For example, a character can pick a staff as their weapon and roll Martial Arts instead of Two-Handed when making weapon attacks with this weapon. In general, good choices include one-handed swords, staves, or spears. The character may only pick one type of weapon and no more. For example, the character who picked staff as their martial weapon cannot pick up a sword and use their Martial Arts skill for its weapon attacks.
