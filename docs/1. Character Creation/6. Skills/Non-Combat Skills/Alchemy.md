The use of herbs and reagents to concoct poultices and remedies is a skill as old as life itself. A devoted alchemist can identify plants and wildlife, often use ancient techniques to extract proper ingredients, and use their skills to create useful potions. While gathering and identification rarely requires specialized tools, crafting potions almost always demands proper apparatuses. An alchemy station or alchemistâ€™s tools are needed to create potions (see crafting skills, alchemy).
