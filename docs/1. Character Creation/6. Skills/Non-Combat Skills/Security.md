Security governs the characters ability to pick locks, disarm physically engineered traps, as well as recognizing more complex puzzle locks and solving them. A lockpicking set is required to perform these actions, although in a pinch a small knife or dagger with a lockpick can do the trick for simpler locks. Thus Security is defined in two categories: improvised and ((equipped?))  
  
Improvised lock picking utilizes simple tools: a lockpick, a form of tension wrench, and anything suitable for hammering to bump the lock. The lockpick can be any sturdy enough metal with a hook or simple bend at the end, and the tension wrench can be a nail file, dagger, small knife, or even a piece of metal bent in an L shape. The hammering tool can be a blacksmith hammer or even a palm-sized rock. This is a very crude method of opening locks, and the character must raise the TN of the lock to succeed with improvised tools.

Lockpicking requires a lockpicking set. These are a set of three to even several dozen tools bound in a leather case for easy organization and storage. The more advanced and numerous the variety of tools, the more bonuses are conferred if the character performing the lockpicking check has the mastery to use them properly.
