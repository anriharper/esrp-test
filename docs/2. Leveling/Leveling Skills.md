Each character is allotted a number of skill points to spend when leveling, determined by their level. The following table shows the number of skill points gained per player level, divided into the categories they must be allotted to:

  

| Player Level | Combat Skill Points | Non-combat Skill Points | Free Skill Points | Restrictions    |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| 1-9          | 10                  | 10                      | 2                 | None above 75   |
| 10-19        | 10                  | 10                      | 5                 | None above 99   |
| 20-29        | 10                  | 10                      | 10                | None above 99   |
| 30-39        | 10                  | 10                      | 20                | None above 105  |
| 40-45        | 10                  | 10                      | 30                | No Restrictions |


Skills level once per skill point until 49, and afterwards require more to level up. Use this table to find out how many skill points are required to level a skill past 49:

| Level Range To Raise | Skill Point Cost |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1-49                 | 1                |
| 50-74                | 3                |
| 75-99                | 5                |
| 100                  | 10               |
| 105                  | 30               |
| 110                  | 60               |
| 115                  | 100              |
| 120                  | 200              |
Once a skill reaches 50, points can be saved towards the next level. For example, a character with 98 Marksman can spend 7 points to bring it to 99, with 2 points saved towards reaching 100. The same rule set applies to reaching 105 from 100 and so forth.
