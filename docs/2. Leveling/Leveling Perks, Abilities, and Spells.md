#### Perks

Every 5 levels, player characters are allowed to select a perk from the list in Section VIII, given they have the required attribute or skill level. Perks work much like Blessings, although they typically have a more direct effect on play style. Some perks offer flat bonuses and others act like Greater Powers: special abilities that can only be activated once every 24 hours.

At character creation, choose three skills and mark them as the character’s core skills. Whenever any of these Skills reaches level 50, and every 25 levels after, until reaching level 100, the character gains a perk for the corresponding skills. 

#### Abilities

There are various attacks and maneuvers that can be made using stamina, called abilities. All player characters begin with the abilities Power Attack and Evade, which allow them to deal bursts of melee damage or dodge attacks at the cost of stamina. The following table shows the number of abilities of different types can be learned at a given skill level:

|     | Novice | Apprentice | Adept | Expert | Master |
| --- | ------ | ---------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 15  | 1      | -          | -     | -      | -      |
| 25  | 2      | 1          | -     | -      | -      |
| 50  | 2      | 2          | 1     | -      | -      |
| 75  | 2      | 2          | 2     | 1      | -      |
| 100 | 2      | 2          | 2     | 2      | 1      |
  
For example, a character with level 50 Two-Handed can pick up to 2 Novice abilities, 2 Apprentice abilities, and 1 Adept ability from all Two-Handed abilities that they meet the requirements for. Once they reach level 75, the table shows that they can pick another Adept ability as well as an Expert ability. Once they reach level 100, they can pick another Expert ability, as well as a Master ability.

It should be noted that a player can choose for their character to know less than the allotted number of abilities, either to avoid clutter or to focus on what they really need. If this is done, the player and GM should decide in what situations a character should be able to regain those foregone allotments. A good suggestion would be to allow the player to declare them at the beginning of a session, along with an explanation as to why the character now knows this, or has not previously used it.

#### Spells

Governed by the five colleges of magic, spells use Magicka as their source of fuel. The Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Restoration, and Illusion skills all have spells that can be learned as they level. There are many more spells than there are abilities, and they have a wide range of functions in and out of combat. For this reason, more spells are learned as these skills are leveled than abilities are learned in their skills. The number of spells a character learns based on their skill level can be shown in the following table:

|     | Novice | Apprentice | Adept | Expert | Master |
| --- | ------ | ---------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 15  | 1      | -          | -     | -      | -      |
| 25  | 2      | 1          | -     | -      | -      |
| 50  | 3      | 2          | 1     | -      | -      |
| 75  | 3      | 3          | 2     | 1      | -      |
| 100 | 3      | 3          | 3     | 2      | 1      |

  
There are also tomes which teach certain spells, however they can be difficult to come by as well as expensive. Often a local college or guild will have a selection of these to sell. A spell learned this way requires several days of study, and the prices of tomes based on their mastery are as follows:

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Mastery|Base Cost|
|Novice|50g|
|Apprentice|100g|
|Adept|350g|
|Expert|750g|
|Master|1,500g|
