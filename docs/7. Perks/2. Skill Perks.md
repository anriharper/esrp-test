### Core Perks
Starting at level 5, the character can choose up to three of their skills to become their core skills, each of which has a series of perks that the character will learn as they level. Whenever a core skill is leveled to 50, 75, and 100, they may learn one perk in that skill, so long as they meet the requirements to do so.
