Each tier requires certain levels of attributes and skills to utilize effectively in combat, and there are penalties to using equipment beyond a character’s capabilities. 

-For armor, the character’s pace is halved in addition to the normal minuses. They also must spend twice as much stamina on any action or reaction that requires it.

-For shields, the character spends twice as much stamina when blocking

-For weapons, the character’s attack rolls are halved

The below tables list the requirements to wield each tier of equipment effectively.

The attribute required is ultimately up to the players and GM to decide, but usually falls in line with the parent attribute of the skill being used.
