The arts of mercantile persuasion and haggling are often intricate and nuanced. When dealing with a merchant, often they will buy items at a third of their base value, while selling them at three times that value. A character can roll a Persuasion check to talk them into better prices, with the resulting effects detailed in the table below.

| Persuade Roll | Buying Rate | Selling Rate |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 2-13          | 1/3x        | 3x           |
| 14-22         | 1/2x        | 2x           |
| 23+           | 3/4x        | 1.5x         |

Merchants do not have limitless resources. Often they will keep a certain amount of coin on hand to buy with. They are also often specialized, and will only deal with goods within the bounds of their given trade.
