### Weapons
Naturally, having the assets to afford a weapon is only half the battle. While many Tier 1 and Tier 2 weapons and armor are quite common to most town and city stores, Tier 3 equipment is a bit uncommon. Tier 4 equipment is rare, even scarce in the largest centers of commerce. Being able to buy Tier 5 equipment is unheard of, as these items are incredibly unique and powerful. It could be said, then, that a person is much more likely to be struck by lightning through an open window on a clear day than they are to find a merchant selling a Tier 6 weapon.
