Most, if not all, Tier 6 armors are unique artifacts whose use has changed the course of history. They are most often rewarded as boons from gods to their most worthy Champions. Some of these are known to take different forms and may have multiple AR’s listed to reflect that they may present as different types of armor.

| This cowl was stolen from Nocturnal, who cursed the thief to be forgotten by all those who would meet him. The wearer gains a +4 to Deception and Stealth checks and abilities. They also gain the ability to see the aura and intentions of all living and non-mechanical creatures within 100 ft, even through walls, as if they had the Detect Life spell active. Creatures with ill-intent towards the wearer or their allies are tinted red, while non-hostile creatures are tinted blue. |

| The Masque belongs to Clavicus Vile, who has a penchant for withdrawing the artifact from its wearer at will. This being said, the Masque is a powerful artifact which has swayed nations and brought death in its wake. It’s visage has changed through time and between wearers, but most often appears as the face of a bearded man with horns. Those who interact with the wearer find themselves trusting them, even long after they part ways and until the mask is removed from the wearer’s possession. The wearer gains a +6 to Deception, Persuade, and Performance rolls, and may reroll any of these once per day and take the higher result. Once per day, the wearer may also choose a creature, and Charm them for one hour should they fail a CHA save of 22. |

| It is said that Hircine will take the hide of a great quarry and transform it into this grand raiment for the hunter. While worn, this armor increases magic resist by 15 and poison resist by 50. When the wearer falls below 25% of their maximum health, the armor doubles their HR until their health is no longer below that point. Whenever the wearer is affected by an elemental effect, they roll a d4. On a 4, the effect is ignored. |

| Wielded by the Dwemer King Rourken, this is one of a handful of armaments remaining that were crafted by the Dwemer themselves. After their disappearance, Spellbreaker appears to have fallen into the hands of Peryite, who grants it to his champions. While held, the wielder may block spells as if they were attack or abilities, creating a ward which emanates from the shield and applies its blocking dice as if it were guarding against a physical attack. When the ward is struck by a spell, the wielder rolls a 1d4. On a 4, the spell is reflected back to the caster, who must succeed a INT save of 22 or be unable to cast spells again for one round. If the wielder has the Elemental Defender perk, the ward's power increases and the blocking pool increases to 4d20+250. |
