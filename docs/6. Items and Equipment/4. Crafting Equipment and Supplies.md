A dedicated crafter needs access to the appropriate tools to practice their craft. Much of the standard equipment can be bulky and difficult to travel with, and often require a home or plot of land to hold. However, the crafters of Tamriel are often known for their generosity in sharing their equipment. The aspiring practitioner can usually use it after business hours or during slow days. Another avenue to consider are the various guilds throughout the continent. The Fighterâ€™s Guild has been known to provide the public both with equipment and guidance. Members can even gain access to materials, if they have the stones for it. For more dedicated crafters, here are the prices for personal sets of equipment.
