The protagonists of the Elder Scrolls series perform incredible feats and survive impossible odds. Given prevalent theories such as Chim, and the nature of magicks such as those categorized in the alteration skills, it is very possible that such heroes bend the very course of time with their unconscious will. To represent this, player characters may use Fate Scrolls to aid them in their time of need.

A Fate Scroll can be spent to gain any of the following effects:

- Break free of any condition listed in Section V as a free action.

- Re-roll a failed skill check, save, reaction, or contest, adding +1 for every 10 levels of the rolled attribute or skill to the end result of whichever roll is higher.

- Perform a single action, movement, or bonus action before the character's turn. This can be used before an enemy's declared action. Note that this is not a free action, simply part of their turn being taken out of turn.

- At the GM's discretion, to perform any number of special feats without having to roll.

In the GM manual, further rules on awarding Fate Scrolls are described, but for simplicity and balance here is a starting set of rules: every player begins the game with a single Fate Scroll, and at the beginning of each completed game session gains another. They can hold a maximum of three Fate Scrolls.

It is helpful, and a bit more interesting, to use some physical token to represent these items. Poker chips and fake doubloons make excellent scrolls.
