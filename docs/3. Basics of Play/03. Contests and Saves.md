Combat is rarely a static and unmoving event. More often than not, it is a dance of actions and reactions. A contested roll, such as most reactions, involves two or more involved parties. The result is decided by the higher roll, and ties favor the defender. A save is typically an Attribute roll with a set TN to beat. The save must result in at least the TN to succeed.
