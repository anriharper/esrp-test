After 1 round the rune detonates, dealing an additional 4d8+20 magic damage to the target and all enemies within 10ft. This curse requires a raise to be dispelled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Targets who fail this save have their pace reduced to 0 for 1 round. An ally within reach of the remnants of these shards, lasting within the area for 1 round, may use an action to channel a blast of energy. Enemies in the area take an additional 4d10+75 damage from this blast, which cannot be avoided by targets with 0 pace. This blast ends the pace reduction effect of this spell.                                                                                                                                      |

| Field of Sigils | -     | 250  | All enemies within 30ft of the caster are marked with a wretched curse for two rounds, dealing 4d20+100 magic damage if any of them perform a chosen act (attack, block, evade, casting a supporting spell, movement). An ally within 5 ft of one of these targets can spend an action to activate a sigil, dealing 4d20+100 magic damage to the target and recovering their own MP or SP by the amount of damage done. Doing so ends to sigil. |
