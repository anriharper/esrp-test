| Dragonknight Banner |   -   | 150  | Calls down a battle standard of fire in an adjacent space within 5ft of the caster, erupting with waves of heat which deal 4d12+100 fire damage to all targets within 20ft. The area lingers for 1 round, reducing healing received by all enemies (including natural HR) by half. An ally within this range can also use an action to manifest flaming shackles on all enemies in the area, dealing 4d12+50 fire damage and additionally reducing their pace to 0 unless they also succeed a STR save of 16. This spell can only be activated once in this way. Channeling this banner wears out its caster, only allowing it to be cast once per day. |

When this spell’s radius grows, roll a 1d4 and deal the corresponding effect to all enemies caught in the radius: 1 - Fire, deal 4d20+100 fire damage; 2 - Frost, all enemies must make an AGI or STR save of 20 or have their pace reduced to zero for one round; 3 - Poison, all enemies that fail an END save of 20 take an additional 4d20+150 poison damage; 4 - Shock, all enemies that fail an END save of 20 cannot cast spells for 1 round. Enemies that enter or begin their turn within the storm take an additional 4d20+100 points of damage. Any resulting element does not gain its passive effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|    Overload     |   -   | 300  | Become an avatar of a chosen element, gaining the corresponding powers for 2 rounds:<br><br>- **Fire**: Use an action and/or bonus action to release a wave of flame, dealing 4d20+100 fire damage to all targets within a 15 ft cone in front of the caster. Use a full turn (movement, action, bonus action, reaction, free action to create a rolling wave of ash in a 30ft radius, dealing 4d20+125 fire damage, creating difficult terrain, and blinding them for one round if they fail a PER save of 20.  <br>- **Frost**: Use a bonus action or reaction to create a wall of frozen shards up to 15 ft long, 5 ft wide, and 15 ft tall. It can be crossed by succeeding an AGI or END save of 24, however the target takes 4d20+125 frost damage. Enemies on the area of the wall when cast also take 4d20+125 frost damage. This also counts as difficult terrain. Use a turn (action, bonus action, reaction, or free action) to call down massive shards of ice, picking 5 locations. The shards deal 4d20+100  physical damage and ignoring armor on impact, then exploding in a wave of ice dealing 4d20+50 frost damage to all targets within 10ft. Overlapping shards do not do additional damage.  <br>- **Poison**: Use an action to envenomate a target in range, dealing 4d20+75 poison damage at the start of their next turn. TN to save subsequent poison damage is 24. Enemies that fail to resist an END save of 20 also become sickly for 1 round, reducing their Attributes by 25 points (See Attributes under Section III: Leveling for information on how points relate to levels). Use a bonus action or reaction to cure the caster or an ally within 60ft of any poison effects. Spend the caster’s turn (action, bonus action, reaction, and free action) creating a web of poison, creating a 60ft area of difficult terrain for all enemies and dealing 4d20+100 poison damage to any that make use their movement, take a sprint action, or make an evade reaction within the next round.  <br>- **Shock**: Use an action and/or bonus action to cast a bolt of lightning at a target within 90ft, dealing 4d20+75 lightning damage and requiring a raise to be reacted to. Spend the caster’s turn to create a wave of lightning around them, dealing 4d20+125 shock damage to all enemies within a 30ft radius. |
