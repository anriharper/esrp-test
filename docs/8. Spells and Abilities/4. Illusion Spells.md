| Leythen’s Codex |  60   |  65  | The caster focuses their energy on a language that they are fluent in and casts this spell on up to ten targets within range. For the next hour, any words spoken by the targets are heard by the caster in the chosen language, regardless of which language these words are truly being spoken in. At will, the caster can use this spell to translate their own words into the primary language of any given target. <br><br>As the spellcaster reachers higher levels of Illusion, this spell becomes more versatile.

Enemies that fail a PER or INT save of 10 treat this illusion as a significant threat, and it can attack them using the caster’s Illusion skill for 4d8+15 psychic damage. Any successful attack, ability, or spell used against the shade dispels it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  Stroke of Death   |  60   | 350  | Speak powerful words of grim demise to the target, marking them with a psychic resonance for 24 hours. As a free action, the caster can force the target to face the visage of their own demise, so long as they are both on the same plane. The target takes 4d20+500 psychic damage, or half as much if they succeed a CHA, END, or INT save of 22. This spell can only be cast once per day, activated once per cast, and only one target can be marked at a time. |
