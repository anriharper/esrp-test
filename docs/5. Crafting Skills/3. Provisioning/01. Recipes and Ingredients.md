This table shows all recipes in the Survival skill and their effects. Keep in mind that all effects are applied to anyone who consumes the meal, usually meaning the character making it and their allies. The effect lasts 24 hours, and cannot be stacked with other Provisioning effects. The ingredients listed are the minimum supplies the provisioner must gather to attempt the recipe.

There is a lot of freedom in choosing ingredients, and the ingredients listed serve as a guideline to ensure recipes are not simply concocted out of thin air. Vegetables can be potatoes, carrots, parsnips, cabbage to name a few, or even any combination of vegetables. Wild gourds, leeks, and other vegetables can sometimes be found during adventures, so these do not necessarily need to be purchased from a market. Wild game can be deer, pheasants, quail, boar, or rabbit to give some examples. Technically farm animal meats like beef, chicken, lamb, turkey, and goat can be bought from markets to substitute this ingredient as well, but the GM will need to make a ruling on safe storage time. Obviously some of these ingredients, such as flour, butter, yeast, cheese and drinks, will likely need to be procured from a market. Storage is important here too, especially for butter and yeast. Any perishable ingredients can be kept for a week or two using ample ice wraith teeth, otherwise it may be necessary to roll for the recipe to make the bread in town. Bread could also be bought rather than made, if the GM agrees to it. To be thorough, the following table lists ingredients and possible prices if bought from a market, as well as their normal shelf-life and where to buy them:

| Ingredient      | Cost | Shelf Life (Room Temperature)                                    | Where to Buy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Ale, mead, wine |      | At least 6 months                                                | Most markets across Tamriel, although not as common in Valenwood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Butter          |      | 1-2 days                                                         | Most markets across Tamriel have access to dairy producing livestock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Cheese          |      | 2-4 hours, but some hard cheeses can last several days to a week | Most markets across Tamriel have access to dairy producing livestock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Coffee Beans    |      | 6 months                                                         | Some markets. Commonly in Elsweyr. Most capital cities outside Elsweyr are likely to have them as well, but at twice the cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Fish            |      | 2 hours                                                          | Most markets in towns and cities with a body of water within a mile or so. Given its low shelf life it’s often sold by fisheries or fishmongers in the early morning.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Fish Roe        |      | 2 hours                                                          | Markets in towns and cities with an active fishery, and still not very common. Given its low shelf life it’s often sold by fisheries  in the early morning. Rarely sold by fishmongers in towns with a body of water within a mile or so                                                                                                                           |
| Flour           |      | 1 year                                                           | Most markets across Tamriel, as well as many outlying farms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Fresh Water     |      | -                                                                | This isn’t as much a question on buying as much as procuring. Good recipes require clean water, often from natural springs or constant flowing rivers and streams. Well water is free and may suffice, but should be boiled before using.                                                                                                                          |
| Fruit           |      | 1 week                                                           | Most areas have a regional fruit that can be purchased at most markets, but this is usually seasonally dependent. The Summerset Isles, southern Cyrodiil, and Elsweyr often have fruit all year round. Skyrim commonly has snowberries and juniper available. There’s a lot of factors, but it can usually be assumed this can be found in most cities.            |
| Game            |      | 2 Hours                                                          | Nearly every part of Tamriel has wild game, and almost anywhere there’s wild game there is also a hunter willing to sell their bounties. Likewise nearly all towns and cities will have farmers who sell chicken, beef, lamb, goat, pork, and more. Meat has to be sold quickly after being butchered, so markets usually have set windows during which they sell. |
| Gold Leaf       |      | -                                                                | Can be procured in wealthy capitals, assuming the character has the money and connections to find a seller. This is usually only available in small amounts and sold to an exclusive set of people by at most a single seller in a city.                                                                                                                           |
| Mushrooms       |      | 7-10 days                                                        | Can be procured through most forests and many caves throughout Tamriel as well as much of Morrowind and Vvardenfell. Mushrooms require caution to gather, as many are poisonous.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Tea Leaves      |      | 6-12 months                                                      | Farmed across Tamriel and sold in many shops in urban markets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
