Improving equipment using the Smithing skill requires a day's worth of work and a Smithing check which raises against the TN of the mastery corresponding to the tier of equipment to be improved. Any equipment can only be improved once. There are a number of ways to improve equipment, detailed in the following sections and determined prior to the beginning of work.

An improvement requires one material, usually one of the first material listed in the recipe. For example, Attuning Shadowspun Armor requires 1 Void Cloth, and Honing a Daedric Sword requires 1 Daedra Heart.

Note that enchanted weapons and armor cannot be repaired or enhanced by normal means, and requires the perk [[4. Non-Combat Skill Perks#Smithing|Arcane Blacksmith]] to work with.Â 

| Improvement | Effect                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attune      | Improve a light armor to let it conduct magic more efficiently, giving the wearer +3 base MR.                                                                                    |
| Banding     | Improve a shield to add one additional die to its blocking dice pool if it is a Tier 1 or 2 shield, two additional dice for a Tier 3 or 4 shield, and three for a Tier 5 shield. |
| Reinforce   | Increases the base AR of any armor by 5                                                                                                                                          |
| Streamline  | Reduces the cost of evading in an improved medium or heavy armor by 10 SP. Light armor cannot be improved in this way.                                                           |
| Insulate    | Increases the magic resistance provided by any armor by 5                                                                                                                        |

Similarly, weapons can be improved in a number of ways:

| Improvement | Effect                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Guarding    | Increases blocking rolls using this weapon by +3. Does not change blocking rolls used by a shield in the off hand.                                          |
| Hone        | Reduces the cost of power attacks with this weapon by 10 SP                                                                                                 |
| Sharpen     | Adds one additional die to its damage dice pool if it is a Tier 1 or 2 weapon, two additional dice for a Tier 3 or 4 weapon, and three for a Tier 5 weapon. |
