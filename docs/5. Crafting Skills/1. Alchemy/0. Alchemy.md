Each alchemical ingredient has four effects, and when one is matched to an effect of another ingredient they are added to determine the effect of the potion. All ingredient effects must be calculated when ingredients are combined. The difficulty in alchemy is that there are a wide variety of effects, all of which are calculated differently from a set of base values given by ingredients. To make this easier, every potion effect that an ingredient can contribute is listed in the following table along with how to calculate the effect of a potion given the characterâ€™s alchemy level and number of matching ingredients.
