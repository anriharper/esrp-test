| Greater  | 100       | 300                | Usually a merchant selling a handful of these can be found in capital cities, and rarely sold by particularly resourceful merchants elsewhere. Ones that are filled are rare, though not unheard of to find several if they know the right place to look.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Grand    | 200       | 500                | These soul gems are exceedingly rare, and to find one in a simple shop is almost unheard of. Enchanters, merchants of magical items, and mages who have spent many years practicing their craft might have one they are willing to part with for a large sum of gold. A person may find a filled gem for sale once in their lifetime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Black    | 400       | 1000               | The only gem even rarer than Grand soul gems, and considered incredibly illegal to possess in most places across Tamriel. They can be crafted from Grand soul gems using ancient rituals at long forgotten altars that number so few that a person could spend their entire lives without hearing an utterance of one. Sometimes they find themselves in old treasure troves of tombs with powerful guardians, and some scholars have spent a lifetime of study only to never see one. To find one filled with the soul of a person would be nothing short of a miracle, and any person possessing one would likely rather go to their grave than let anyone know of it. |
