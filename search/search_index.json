Though their religion has fluctuated between the eras, worship of the Divines has more often than not gone hand-in-hand with Altmer culture.

Their tribes make their homes deep in the marshes, whose towering canopies can all but blot out the sun, and build their settlements from mud or clay and sometimes wood. The once magnificent xanmeers constructed by their ancient ancestors are reclaimed by the roots and vines, the pyramid structures serving as a reminder that in Argonia all things are better built to be temporary. Still, Argonian craftsmanship and jewelry is revered around the known world, and their alchemical knowledge and precision is almost unparalleled.

The Chimer who descended from Veloth\u2019s followers were cursed by Azura after the disappearance of the dwarves for breaking an oath to the goddess and following the Tribunal who arose from the Battle of Red Mountain. They became ashen toned with red eyes, and as the Dunmer they went on to create great cities in the eastern fens and volcanic mountains. Their story from then on was one harsh and marred with ill-fortune and conflict. The volcanic heat gave them a natural resistance to fire, and their society of Great Houses gave birth to skilled and versatile warriors. But their civilization was built on the blood and sweat of slavery, with plantations and mines worked mostly by khajiit and argonian captives even into the waning years of the 3rd Era. Morrowind cultivated a unique culture, dominated for millennia by the god-like Tribunal.

They are naturally among the first races to ever settle in Tamriel, and among the few who are likely native to the continent. Hundreds of their cities were built in southern Tamriel, many long buried in shifting sands or reclaimed by deep rainforest foliage. Like the elven Silvenar, their Mane who leads them is believed to be reborn through the ages long after the first to claim the mantle united Elsweyr in ancient times. Though the Mane holds much power, it is the Clan Mothers who oversee the trade of Moon Sugar that drives Khajiit culture. The plant, which has powerful euphoric effects along with sometimes dangerous consequences, has found its way throughout Elsweyr cuisine and distilled into drugs such as skooma, which is illegal in much of Tamriel. Khajiit physiology is diverse and commanded by phases of the moons which they hold in great reverence and worship. Many breeds of Khajiit come in various shapes and sizes from being almost indistinguishable from a household cat to house-sized battle cats. Most commonly seen are the bipedal suthay-raht and larger cathay Khajiit. The language of the Khajiit is Ta\u2019agra, spoken primarily in third person and lending the earned suffixes that many Khajiit have to their names. They are agile, stealthy, and have both quick reflexes and excellent night vision. These natural capacities combined with sharp business sense and charisma leads some Khajiit to lucrative careers in thievery and swindling, which in turn gives their race a very unfortunate reputation that is most often unwarranted.

Nord","text":"<p>Lying beyond the northern Sea of Ghosts is the frozen island of Atmora, long believed to be abandoned by the Nedes who would settle a northern portion of Tamriel. Their descendants, the Nords, came from the warlord Ysgramor and his Five-Hundred Companions of old to claim Skyrim and become perhaps the first humans to settle in Tamriel. Large, imposing, and accustomed to the cold climate of their homeland, the Nords have known only battle since their arrival. They sundered the Snow Elves and Dwemer who originally inhabited the land and drove them to the east, fought the giants whose remnants still herd mammoths across the tundra and planes, and rebelled against the Dragon Cult and their immortal masters. They even tried and failed to conquer Morrowind in the First Era, thwarted by a combined Chimer and Dwemer force. War is in their blood and life is often short-lived and harsh in Skyrim. So much so that for thousands of years the position of High King carried a life expectancy of less than a year. The High King could be challenged to trial by combat, a Moot of the nine Holds\u2019 Jarls could elect a new leader, and Nord nobility never cease to seek to prove themselves worthy of a higher place in their court. They have long worshipped the Aedra, as well as Shor who holds dominion of the great halls of Sovngarde, where all Nord warriors hope to dine in for eternity by dying honorably in battle. Travelling bard adventures bring music to the countless taverns dotting the lands, ever flowing with ale and mead. Their capital cities are ruled by courts headed by a Jarl, often accompanied by a steward, a court wizard, and an assembly of Thanes and their housecarls. The Jarl commands authority over their district, answering to the High King, who through most of history has been allied to the Cyrodiilic empires. Nords are taller than other humans, with fair skin and lighter red, brown, or blonde hair. Their eyes are typically green or blue, though sometimes brown or amber. Their physical abilities make them formidable soldiers, mercenaries, and sailors, as well as dependable farmers and miners. Since life is short, they often marry early and quickly, simply wearing an Amulet of Mara to signify that they are single and looking to start a family.  </p>"},{"location":"1.%20Character%20Creation/1.%20Races/08.%20Nord/#racial-bonuses","title":"Racial Bonuses","text":"<p>Starting Attributes: S45/P35/E45/C25/I35/A25/L35  </p> <p>Skill Bonuses:  - +10 to One-Handed or Two-Handed, +5 to the other - +5 Block, Marksman, Throwing, and Survival</p> <p>Additional Bonuses: 50% Frost Resist</p> <p>Natural Powers (Choose One):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Battlecry</p> <p>The character lets out a deafening roar, bolstering themselves and allies for a short period.

Along the Iliac Bay and deep into the Wrothgarian mountains, the Aldmer who worshipped the Aedric god-warrior Trinimac were believed to be transformed by a terribly curse when Boethia defeated their deity. Trinimac became Malacath, and the Aldmer who followed him became the Orsimer. Called Orcs by many of the other races, the green and tusked Orsimer are nearly as tall as their Altmer relatives, though much more physically imposing. They have held no kingdom since their last was destroyed in the middle of the First Era, and without a home they have faced persecution and prejudice over the many centuries after. Their city or Orsinium has been raised, destroyed, moved, and raised again numerous times throughout history, and those that have not been able to make homes within foreign cities have nestled into the northern mountains in secluded fortresses. Honor is of the utmost importance to the Orsimer, who follow the Code of Malacath. To slight someone is to submit to the price of betrayal, either by gold or by blood. The nomadic Orsimer of the fortresses adopt a culture meant to ensure only the strongest lineage is allowed to continue. The Chieftain proves themselves to be the strongest, and worthy of taking wives and having offspring. Clans often trade people to form strong bonds and stronger progeny. As brutal as this life can be, Orsimer men of the clans do not expect to live long. In fact, it is considered by many to be shameful for one to grow old, and that it is better to die to a worthy opponent than continue past their prime. The women are expected to be strong and fearsome. They are traditionally the smiths of the clans, and their prowess for metalworking is unrivaled in Tamriel. Stronghold life is one that many Orsimer escape by joining militaries, using their renowned fighting and smithing skills to travel the world. Orsimer usually have black hair and green or yellow eyes, with large frames and bold features.

Most now believe that Yokuda was swallowed by the sea by an unknown event, causing the remaining fleets to sail east until they landed in what is now called Hammerfell. Reguard history holds that Frandar Hunding won the War of the Singers, the final war in Yokuda, after the Last Emperor Hira of the Ansei called on his aid. Legend has it that in the wake of the bloody conflict, Yokuda sank into the sea and the forces that sailed with Hunding across the Eltheric Ocean became known as the Redguards. The incredibly skilled warriors wrested control of Hammerfell from man and mer alike in a matter of months, and after the Siege of Orsinium nearly two centuries later began to trade with their neighbors. In the sprawling Alik\u2019r desert, the mountains of Bangkorai and Craglorn, and rocky wastelands beyond the lush grasslands of Hammerfell\u2019s coasts, the Redguards built walled cities composed of towering dome structures with novel ventilation systems. Though newer to Tamriel than the other races, Redguard warriors are considered the most skilled and disciplined in the world and their advanced naval forces have been matched only by the Empire\u2019s greatest armadas. They have a dark complexion, ranging from soft brown hues to midnight tones that are almost black, often all with characteristic red and orange undertones. They have brown to amber eyes, and dark hair that usually curls elegantly in shades of brown and black.

If caught by the guards in that place they will certainly be arrested to serve their sentence or defend themselves in court. 5-9 Crossed Paths A friend or family member often runs into this character, and often brings chaotic events with them. 10-14 Haunted A mischievous or even malicious spectre follows the character wherever they go, and with little adjustments and small actions seeks to make their life more difficult. 15-19 Nemesis Adventurers often make close friends along the way, but sometimes they will make lifelong enemies. The character has someone who is their nemesis, their foil, their antithesis, whether the relationship be competitive or deadly. 20-24 Refugee The character has known their share of suffering, as some cataclysmic event in their past led them to leave their home in search of safety and a new life. Perhaps it was war, perhaps a natural disaster. 25-29 Folk Hero The character performed a great deed in a small town or village, and the people there remember them kindly.

The responsibility, and should they find it inheritance, of all their predecessors rests on their shoulders. 50-54 Amnesia The character woke up recently with almost no memory of their life beforehand. Maybe the memories will never come back to them, but the only direction left is forward. 55-59 Treasure Map The character has found a treasure map and has made it their quest to decipher it! It could be a riddle, a clue, a simple drawn map, anything leading to a no doubt grand adventure. 60-64 Possession An otherworldly spirit or creature is tethered to the character, always in the back of their mind and waiting for control. When the character rolls any check where the majority of the dice land on the same number, the entity may take control of them for three rounds. 65-69 A Night to Remember A likely alcohol-fueled romp took the character on an unpredictable adventure.

The exact events are up to the GM, but typically involve two helpful acts and two reckless 70-74 Unwanted Inheritance A relative has passed, leaving the character with some unfortunate inheritance.

Someone with an Expert level of Stealth could be a nationally notorious thief. Masters are incredibly rare, and hold a lifetime of knowledge in their field.

This means the action was executed incredibly well, and often the term Raise will appear in effects. When making an uncontested roll, one raise is achieved for every double of the target rolled, then double the previous raise. Say the target is 5, the first raise occurs when a 10 is rolled. The second occurs at 20, and the third at 40. For contested rolls, each raise occurs for every double of the target rolled above the opposing roll.

If the character is invisible or under the chameleon effect, the searching creature must roll an additional d100 as a percentage chance to fail that detection.

This rating reduces physical damage done to the character by a percentage equal to the AR (20AR=20% damage reduction) or by half as much from damaging spells (20AR reduces fire damage by 10%). The maximum attainable armor rating is 80, meaning any AR in excess of that number is ignored unless otherwise stated by a spell or ability.\u00a0</p> <p>Armors can be cumbersome and will exacerbate the energy needs of sprinting.

Medium armors give only a -2 to Stealth rolls, while heavy armors give a -5.</p> <p>Resistances to non-physical types of damage such as magic also generally have a maximum of 80. This means a character can have enchanted equipment to bring their Magic Resistance to 100, but will only reduce incoming magical damage by 80%. Some resistances are additive, such as magical and elemental resistance. A character with 50 Magic Resist and 25 Fire Resist will ignore a total of 75% of fire damage. However, the same maximum still applies.\u00a0</p> <p>When a character has a weakness to a specific element and a resistance to magic, or vise versa, the difference is their overall resistance to the element, to a maximum of 80%.

This, in essence, adds half the user\u2019s AR to their Magic Resist score.</p> <p>Immunities are rare, but function as a 100% resistance, which overrides any starting values or acquired perks. An effect can still decrease this amount temporarily, but must account for starting resistances that the immunity would have otherwise overrode. However, starting weaknesses are not counted, as they were already cancelled by the immunity.</p> <p>It is possible to gain a special type of resistance called Absorb, allowing the character a chance to absorb an incoming spell and replenish their magicka. Once the spell is confirmed to hit and before any damage is accounted for, the character rolls a d100 against their absorb chance. If they roll at or below, any spell effects are negated and they gain MP equal to half base cost of the spell. Damage from area of effect spells can be absorbed on indirect hits, but the spell still affects another other targets in range normally. The maximum absorb rating is 75, and any amount over is ignored much like armor and resistance caps. Any spell with the Non-resistible effect is assumed to ignore Absorb.</p> <p>Another form of protection is a damage shield. For the duration of its effect, a damage shield protects from up to a certain amount of incoming damage. A 100 point damage shield, for example, could reduce a 235 damage hit to 135 damage. However, once the total point value of the shield is used in reducing damage, its effect ends. The damage shield is cumulative, rather than per attack.

For either, all incoming damage is reduced by a percentage equal to the target\u2019s resistance score. If the effect does not cause damage, the resist is rolled as a d100 against a successful hit.

For example if an adventurer has a sword with a fire enchantment which deals 25 points of fire damage, the enchanting table lists this as needing level 50 enchanting to craft and is therefore a level 50 enchantment. The table above shows that once the blade needs to be recharged it will require at least a Common level soul to do so. For recharging the effect can also be additive, so a Lesser \u00a0and Petty soul can be combined to charge a weapon whose enchantment is up to level 70. Note that given the rules of Azura\u2019s Star, artifact enchantments (enchantments whose level is above 100) do not need to be recharged.</p> <p>If no one in a party is able to recharge a weapon, they may need to find someone who will offer this service for a fee. The person may need to be convinced to take the time to do this depending on their personality, but for simplicity the following rules can be followed:</p> Enchantment Level Soul Gem Cost Service Fee Total Up to 25 250 125 375 Up to 45 500 250 750 Up to 65 1000 500 1500 Up to 85 2000 1000 3000 Up to 100 3000 1500 4500 Up to 105 3000* 2500* 6500* <p>*Note that most mages may not have access to black soul gems or condone their use, and soul trapping humanoids is illegal in most places</p> <p>If the character is able to bring the appropriate soul gem, the service fee still applies based on the enchantment level.</p>"},{"location":"5.%20Crafting%20Skills/2.%20Enchanting/00.%20Enchanting/#enchanting-table","title":"Enchanting Table","text":""},{"location":"5.%20Crafting%20Skills/2.%20Enchanting/00.%20Enchanting/#effects","title":"Effects","text":""},{"location":"5.%20Crafting%20Skills/2.%20Enchanting/00.%20Enchanting/#list-of-soul-gems-and-locations","title":"List of Soul Gems and Locations","text":""},{"location":"5.%20Crafting%20Skills/2.%20Enchanting/01.%20Enchanting%20Table/","title":"01.

Provisioning","text":"<p>While Survival is also used to manage and find resources in the wild, it doubles as a crafting skill. A character can use Survival to prepare meals during times of rest, and if successful will provide their allies with bonuses based on the recipe. Recipes act much like abilities or spells in that they are picked by the player based on the character\u2019s Survival level as it is raised to each mastery. The table below shows the maximum number of recipes that can be learned based on the character\u2019s current mastery:</p> Apprentice Adept Expert Master 25 1 - - - 50 2 1 - - 75 3 2 1 - 100 3 3 2 1 <p>For any given recipe there is a target range to successfully make it. The provisioner much roll at the mastery\u2019s TN or above to achieve the recipe\u2019s effect, and failing that the recipe is still made but does not impart any of its bonuses. Luckily the party still gets a decent meal out of this. Rolling very low gives the party food poisoning, and carries the opposite effect of the recipe. This decreases the maximum life stat or first roll by the same amount it would be gained. For example a Hearty Meal (shown in the recipe table) that gives food poisoning would decrease maximum health by 20%. At the same time a character can be struck with inspiration, preparing their recipe so that its effect is increased by half its original value The next table shows the ranges for each outcome based on mastery.

Vegetables can be potatoes, carrots, parsnips, cabbage to name a few, or even any combination of vegetables. Wild gourds, leeks, and other vegetables can sometimes be found during adventures, so these do not necessarily need to be purchased from a market. Wild game can be deer, pheasants, quail, boar, or rabbit to give some examples. Technically farm animal meats like beef, chicken, lamb, turkey, and goat can be bought from markets to substitute this ingredient as well, but the GM will need to make a ruling on safe storage time. Obviously some of these ingredients, such as flour, butter, yeast, cheese and drinks, will likely need to be procured from a market. Storage is important here too, especially for butter and yeast. Any perishable ingredients can be kept for a week or two using ample ice wraith teeth, otherwise it may be necessary to roll for the recipe to make the bread in town. Bread could also be bought rather than made, if the GM agrees to it. To be thorough, the following table lists ingredients and possible prices if bought from a market, as well as their normal shelf-life and where to buy them:</p> Ingredient Cost Shelf Life (Room Temperature) Where to Buy Ale, mead, wine At least 6 months Most markets across Tamriel, although not as common in Valenwood. Butter 1-2 days Most markets across Tamriel have access to dairy producing livestock. Cheese 2-4 hours, but some hard cheeses can last several days to a week Most markets across Tamriel have access to dairy producing livestock. Coffee Beans 6 months Some markets. Commonly in Elsweyr. Most capital cities outside Elsweyr are likely to have them as well, but at twice the cost. Fish 2 hours Most markets in towns and cities with a body of water within a mile or so. Given its low shelf life it\u2019s often sold by fisheries or fishmongers in the early morning. Fish Roe 2 hours Markets in towns and cities with an active fishery, and still not very common. Given its low shelf life it\u2019s often sold by fisheries\u00a0 in the early morning. Rarely sold by fishmongers in towns with a body of water within a mile or so Flour 1 year Most markets across Tamriel, as well as many outlying farms. Fresh Water - This isn\u2019t as much a question on buying as much as procuring. Good recipes require clean water, often from natural springs or constant flowing rivers and streams. Well water is free and may suffice, but should be boiled before using. Fruit 1 week Most areas have a regional fruit that can be purchased at most markets, but this is usually seasonally dependent. The Summerset Isles, southern Cyrodiil, and Elsweyr often have fruit all year round. Skyrim commonly has snowberries and juniper available. There\u2019s a lot of factors, but it can usually be assumed this can be found in most cities. Game 2 Hours Nearly every part of Tamriel has wild game, and almost anywhere there\u2019s wild game there is also a hunter willing to sell their bounties. Likewise nearly all towns and cities will have farmers who sell chicken, beef, lamb, goat, pork, and more. Meat has to be sold quickly after being butchered, so markets usually have set windows during which they sell. Gold Leaf - Can be procured in wealthy capitals, assuming the character has the money and connections to find a seller. This is usually only available in small amounts and sold to an exclusive set of people by at most a single seller in a city. Mushrooms 7-10 days Can be procured through most forests and many caves throughout Tamriel as well as much of Morrowind and Vvardenfell. Mushrooms require caution to gather, as many are poisonous. Tea Leaves 6-12 months Farmed across Tamriel and sold in many shops in urban markets."},{"location":"5.%20Crafting%20Skills/4.%20Smithing/0.%20Smithing/","title":"0.

The list below will help the aspiring smith know how to convert from one to the next, and what equipment will be used. Most, if not all smithing requires a worktable as well, and this is assumed to be on hand. These are the listed equipments and their details:</p> <p>Clothier Station: A work station with equipment necessary for taking fabrics and leathers to turn into clothes and armor. Often accompanied by tools such as sewing needles, a hammer, pliers, shears, and nails.</p> <p>Forge: A complete forge needs an anvil, a hammer, tongs, some form of cooling liquid in a container, and the force itself to heat the metal. Be sure to always wear gloves and an apron for safety! Loom: A fantastic device perfect for processing raw fabrics as well as weaving cloth.</p> <p>Tanning Rack: A curing station made to turn raw hides into leathers.</p> <p>Smelter: A large, often metal device which melts and refines raw ore into ingots.</p> <p>Woodworking Station: A workstable featuring a peddle saw and various tools such as a hammer, tongs, vice grips, pliers, nails, and a carving knife.</p> <p>Prices and possible means of borrowing the above equipment can be found at the end of section VI under Crafting Equipment and Supplies.</p> Created Material Used Materials Equipment Leather (x3) Pristine Pelt Tanning Rack Leather Strips (x4) Leather Clothier Station Cotton Raw Cotton (x2) Loom Iron Ingot Iron Ore Smelter Corundum Ingot Corundum Ore (x2) Smelter Spidersilk Raw Spidersilk (2) Loom Ionthread Raw Ironweed (2) Loom Steel Ingot Corundum Ore, Iron Ore Smelter Silver Ingot Silver (x2) Smelter Dwarven Ingot (2) Dwarven Scrap Smelter Silverweave Raw Silverweed (x2) Loom Quicksilver Ingot Quicksilver Ore (x2) Smelter Refined Moonstone Moonstone Ore (x2) Smelter Orichalcum Ingot Orichalcum Ore (x2) Smelter Void Cloth Raw Void Bloom (x2) Loom Refined Malachite Raw Malachite (x2) Smelter Ebony Ingot Ebony Ore (x2) Smelter <p>A few notes on timing:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tanning processes are often accelerated by simple herbs, which often carry magical properties in Tamriel.

A crafter with ample time in their day can prepare up to five pristine pelts to turn into leather within 2-3 days.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Cutting leather is a much faster matter. The 15 workable pieces of leather produced from a days worth of tanned hides can be shorn to size in a matter of hours.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Plant-based fabrics can be processed rather quickly on a loom. Each bundle takes half an hour to produce a spool of thread or cloth, so a crafter could be expected to make 16 spools in a single day.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Ores can take 10 hours to prepare for smelting and another 2-3 hours to tap the slag into molds.

The spell attack roll must meet the target\u2019s passive TN or exceed any contested Evade roll to successfully strike the target. Healing and other beneficial spells may refer to \u201ctarget\u201d to specify that only one creature is affected. However, the spell roll does not have to meet their passive TN to connect. The only other exception are cloaking spells, which do not require a passing TN to activate.</p> <p>Hostile spells that avoid the word \u201ctarget\u201d are uncommon but purposeful. If \u201ctarget\u201d cannot be found in such a spell\u2019s description, the spell succeeds in affecting the chosen creature so long as the spellcaster meets the spell\u2019s TN.</p> <p>Spells that use the terms \u201cconcentration\u201d or phrase \u201cconcentrating on\u201d are spells that the caster needs a certain level of focus to maintain. Only one such spell can be concentrated on at a time. When taking a reaction, being struck, or otherwise taking any damage, the spellcaster must succeed a saving throw using the related skill (Conjuration for a Conjuration spell, etc.) against the TN of its mastery to continue concentrating on its spell. Each subsequent hit or reaction requires the caster to raise that TN to maintain concentration.</p>"},{"location":"8.%20Spells%20and%20Abilities/00.%20Spellcasting/#area-of-effect","title":"Area of Effect","text":"<p>There are spells that affect an area rather than a single creature.
